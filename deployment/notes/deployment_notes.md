# Section 2: Deployment

We'll be deploying our model using [Amazon's SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/).

## 1. What's the *machine learning workflow*?

## 2. How does ***deployment\*** fit into the *machine learning workflow*?

## 3. What is *cloud computing*?

## 4. Why would we use *cloud computing* for ***deploying\*** machine learning models?

## 5. Why isn't deployment a part of many machine learning curriculums?

## 6. What does it mean for a model to be ***deployed\***?

## 7. What are the *essential* characteristics associated with the code of *deployed models*?

## 8. What are *different* cloud computing platforms we might use to ***deploy\*** our machine learning models?

At the end of this lesson, you'll understand the broader idea of ***machine learning deployment\***. Then Sean will be guiding you through using [SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) to *deploy* your own machine learning models. This is a lot to cover, but by the end you will have a general idea of *all* the concepts related to *deploying machine learning models* into real world *production systems*.
