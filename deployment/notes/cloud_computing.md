# Cloud Computing

## ① What is cloud computing?

At a high level, cloud computing is now the main way transforming an IT product into an IT service.

In the old world, we would be storing our vacation photos onto an IT production, the **flash drive**. In the new world, we'll be storing them using an IT service, like **Google Drive**.

Using these services provide the benefits of making it easier to access and share these photos, because the product is no longer explicitly necessary. You'll only need a device with an internation connection to *access* these photos and to grant permission to others to access these same photos.

The democratizes what used to be the realm of many IT hardware products, and eases them into a single product, **an internet connection**.

Other cloud services include direct applications, databases, virtual machines, and other services, such as SageMaker, for Machine Learning!

## ② Why would a business decide to use cloud computing?

Most of the factors for cloud computing come down to **time** and **cost**. IT resources necessary, such as compute capacity, storage, and networking that are needed to meet customer demand for a business' products and **costs** associated with those resources. In the photos example, *customer demand* is for storing and sharing customer photos. The *IT resources* are the required software and hardware that enables photo storage and sharing, whether it be *in the cloud* or *on-premise*.

Traditional infrastructure has challenges to scale, most generally where there are spikes in demand. And also leaves a little bit of excess when preparing for future demand. This ability to easily meet unstable, fluctuating *customer demand* illustrates one of the many benefits of cloud computing.

### Benefits Summarized ([AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-computing/), [Google](https://cloud.google.com/what-is-cloud-computing/), [Microsoft](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-cloud-computing/))

1. Reduced Investments and Proportional Costs (providing cost reduction)
2. Increased Scalability (providing simplified capacity planning)
3. Increased Availability and Reliability (providing organizational agility)

### Risks Summarized (AWS: [Security](https://aws.amazon.com/security/security-learning/) + [SLA](https://aws.amazon.com/legal/service-level-agreements/), Google: [Security](https://cloud.google.com/security/data-safety/) + [SLA](https://cloud.google.com/compute/sla), Microsoft [Security](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trust-center) + [SLA](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/sla/))

1. Potential Increase in Security Vulnerabilities
2. Reduced Operational Control (over cloud resources)
3. Limited Portability Between Cloud Providers
4. Multi-regional Compliance and Legal Issues
5. Service Level Agreements Shift Responsibilities (uptime, security) to Users
