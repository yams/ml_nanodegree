# Amazon SageMaker

## ① Introduction

SageMaker flow is: Computation Task is constructed - normally to fit a model to some data, made inside of a Virtual Machine. After the fit model has been created, the model is then saved as a "Saved Model", into a data group known as the **Model Artifacts**.

Inference is similar. First construct a Computational Task to *Perform an Inference*, which is made inside a Virtual Machine. In this case, the Virtual Machine **waits** for us to send some data as **Input**. Once we do, it takes that Data, along with the **Model Artifacts** from the previous step, and generates **Results**.
